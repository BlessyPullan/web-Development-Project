# web-Development-Project
This project is a basic healthcare informatics web form for collecting patient information. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end. On the back end, PHP connects to a MySQL database where records are stored and retrieved. The system generates a unique patient ID and supports file uploads.
